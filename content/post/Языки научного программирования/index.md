## Overview

1. Python - high-level general-purpose programming language with dynamic strong typing and automatic memory management, focused on improving developer productivity, code readability and quality, as well as ensuring the portability of programs written in it
2. C# - object-oriented programming language. It was developed in 1998-2001 by a group of Microsoft engineers led by Anders Hejlsberg and Scott Wilthaumot as an application development language for the Microsoft .NET Framework. It was subsequently standardized as ECMA-334 and ISO/IEC 23270.
3. Java - a strongly typed general-purpose object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems. Development is driven by a community organized through the Java Community Process; the language and the main technologies that implement it are distributed under the GPL license
